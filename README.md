# Pipelined MIPS Processor Simulator
## Second project of the UF 21 fall CAP class
### This project was developed on top of project 1, with some modification and extension, it can perform much more complicated cycle-by-cycle simulation. <br/>
### This simulator will take a txt file contains only binary codes as input, and then generate the assembly codes accordingly just like project 1.
### Then it will simulate the processor cycle-by-cycle and print out the simulation result, which contains the contents of registers, queues, and memory data for each cycle.
## The processor's architecture that it needs to simulate: <br/>
